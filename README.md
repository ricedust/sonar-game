## About

Sonar is a simple space invaders style, arcade shooter where you control a submarine from behind a sonar panel in an unbounded and hostile ocean.

Sonar is written almost from scratch in C++ using the OpenGL-based [openFrameworks library](https://openframeworks.cc/).

I also custom wrote a primitive game engine backed by an Entity Component System (ECS) to support the game's functionalities. This can be found in the src/core directory.
I used [David Colson's fabulous ECS guide](https://www.david-colson.com/2020/02/09/making-a-simple-ecs.html) as a starting point to which I applied my own flavor and functionalities.

All assets, including graphics, sound, and music are original.
